ESLint is used to enforce code quality and consistent formatting (with the help of Prettier). If ESLint complains when you run `npm run build-and-verify`, you can run `npm run lint-fix` to apply automatic fixes and and then fix the rest of the errors manually. I recommend configuring your IDE for ESLint and Prettier. If you are using Visual Studio Code, simply installing [Microsoft's ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [the official Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) takes care of that.
